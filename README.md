The code is implemented and tested with python 3.6 on Ubuntu. It does not utilize any third party libraries.

Running it is strait forward, there is only a single python script named resolve.py.
Assuming python 3 is installed, open a terminal (or cmd) in the directory where the script is located and run the given script as:

python3 resolve.py

which will generate a txt file named output.txt in the directory.
This output file contains a distance matrix just like the example given in the problem definition.

As requested I also included an example output named as example_output.txt

Please do contact me if you have any questions.

Best regards.
